# [Next Auth](https://nextauth-jwt.vitorpatzlaff.vercel.app/)
This is a test web app made with NextAuth.js. This lib is used to make authentication system in Next easier, I used jwt method to do it. Visit [Next Auth](https://next-auth.js.org/) to see more about it.  
You can create an user with an email and a password, then you can use it to log in or change password. This user data is storaged in MongoDB. The page does not do anything, it is just a course project to learn a bit more about Next.js.
